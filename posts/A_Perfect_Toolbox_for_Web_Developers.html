Title: A Perfect Toolbox for Web Developers

<em>CAUTION: Read through the next lines only if you have the slightest of interests in stuffs like Web design and development. If you don't have any interest,  it’s a MUST-NOT read. </em>

Here is a list of some tools that may come in handy for you in the entire Web project development and maintenance. You can download the tools online as most of them are free.

<strong>Web Browser:</strong>

You should have a good mix of browsers to test your designs on various browsers. Test your project on at least on all of these- IE 6.0+, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Opera. Firefox races ahead (for me) as  a development platform. You can also run your website and see how it behaves on different browsers online on a pay-per-view basis here- <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">www.browsercam.com/</a>

<strong>Code Editor:</strong>

Macromedia Dreamweaver and Notepad++ top the list for me.

<strong>FTP Client:</strong>

Apart from native Windows OS FTP client, standalone applications are good- WS_FTP and CuteFTP, work on all platforms.

<strong>Validation Tool:</strong>

For validating your code with scripts you should use Dreamweaver. It has a powerful in-built code validation mechanism.

<strong>Bitmap Image Programs:</strong>

For raster image editing, Photoshop lies way ahead of others though the open source GIMP is becoming ever famous among the designers, not only because its free but also as it has tremendous applicability.

<strong>Vector Drawing Tools:</strong>

If you are in logo designing, you should use applications such as Adobe Illustrator for drawing shapes.

<strong>Animator programs:</strong>

Adobe ImageReady (comes packed with Photoshop) and many other animator tools. Macromedia Flash adds new dimension to your site when needed.

<strong>Renaming Utility:</strong>

For renaming files and/or extensions with ease-  an application program called 'A Better File Rename'. To download A Better File Rename, see <a href="http://www.publicspace.net/">www.publicspace.net/</a>

<strong>Compression Utility:</strong> WinZip

<strong>Web Server:</strong>

Depends on your working platform. I mostly use WAMP as I go with PHP and MySql combo most if the times.

This much suffices I guess. You should at least have this much with you while you develop your web project.

Thanks for reading.
