Title: Busy (In Continuation!)

Hi there!

First of all, happy birthday wishes to Upen (scroll down to next entry to know more about this guy- this is called <em>backward referencing</em>, I still remember the old  sleepy classroom lectures, nice isn't it)

It seems my easy relaxing days with endless hours have finally come to an end. For the last two days I've been counting minutes to get my pending works done which range from the medical check-ups to going to the local grocer. I am not complaining of all this, its better in most ways. My mind is jumbled right now (surely signs of days to come of training in Mysore), so won't go into counting my moves form here to there today, like I did in the previous entry. I am sure most of you (of course if you went through that) wouldn’t have cared to get their minds into my activities. Why would you, really? But as I say, I own this blog, so eat the following lines, even if you don't want-
<ul>
	<li>I got my medical certificate from the hospital after two days of tests. I was formally declared fully fit physically to join Infosys Technologies as per the company policies. So two of the doubts cleared- a) my physical fitness and b) my joining Infy ;-)</li>
	<li> My PAN card arrived at my home. Yes, the courier guy brought that, the world is still normal ;-)</li>
	<li>I've started my shopping (pre joining (in)formalities), and its peaking slowly :-)</li>
</ul>
Enough of self-talk, though I may continue talking about me for next several windows. People who know me would surely agree.

Its my duty to share some other local, national and international news and enlighten you. After all, India TV has not started covering your and my homes yet (at least most of ours). Neither google news has advanced much.
<ul>
	<li>Starting from World cup again, the ESPN-Star anchor, Maya (is it her name, anyways probably you got it who I want you to picture in your mind) is looking fabulous tonight (Spain v Portugal match)<em> [citation needed]. </em>And so did Swati yesterday (the same girl I talked about in the last entry- perhaps this makes many of you to scroll down and read that post ;-). Talking of her, she is going home, finally, on 4th.</li>
	<li>Venus Williams is out of the championship and so is my favorite Andy Roddick.</li>
	<li>Our very own Sania wins…oops, correction, Saina wins the super series in Indonesia again.</li>
	<li>Sadique (surely with his gang) is off to Kolkata, I don’t know why. His (one of many) younger bro told me this. Please don't mind Sadique, every time I call your home, I hear a different kids sweet voice.</li>
	<li>And yes, Pratichi and Co. going to get their first salaries very very soon. So keep your nice relations with them in tact ;-) Just joking people, congratulations to them on being first among us to have a salary account at the bank.</li>
</ul>
Ending on this happy note for now. Hope to see you soon.

PS: Amey still is waiting for his results and so are other candidates, perhaps. So keep wishing him good luck for the result ;-)
