<div align="justify"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">I was hanging around with my laptop that day in the evening when I heard the loud cheer of happiness outside the hostel. They were the final year and 5th semester students, as the dates of the semester exams were out and were scheduled to be 15-20 days hence. I wondered why they were, oddly, so delighted (I noticed this more than my 2nd year friends as my room is in the senior block). Then I got to know that they were happy because they'd got some more days with no studies and the tension of exams.<br /></span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Same have been case of us (the 2nd year batch). In the 1st and 2nd semester exams we used to do some serious study only with around 30 days in hand before the exams and got fairly good GPAs (average if not good). Even those studies were not involving the good standard textbooks rather few local publication books, question banks and the study materials from Sagar Xerox especially made for BPUT exams.<br /></span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Its not that we are perky and careless students, the fact is that the exam pattern of BPUT is such that we are still trapped in the days of the schools' terminal exams when teachers used to provide us with VVIs and we'd mug them up and happily come out of the exam hall. I rate myself nothing in front of educationalists, scholars and specialist who prepare and decide the exam pattern and other related things. But we are the ones who see it in reality throughout our semester studies. Major part of the marks is swept by a few long questions with minimal portion of application in them.<br /></span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">I am not pointing that exams are too easy to the standards. Actually I want to emphasize the relevance of exams keeping an eye on our future. Are these theories having that much importance that they have a 70-30 share in the total marks over the labs? The laboratories and workshops are of great significance as we get used to the working environment we are about to face in our near future. A few months back in an article in 'Hindu' an Indian-American eighth grader was pointing out the differences between the methodologies of the education of the two countries. The fundamental reason why most of the world known scientists, astronauts, biologists, physicians and entrepreneurs are from those countries lies in their educational system which rests heavily on real life projects, experiments and workshops. Every intellect of India is quite aware of the points made above but we donâ€™t see any positive move in the pattern here.<br /><br />With the grounds of our BPUT exams, there should be more weight for the practical than the theoretical studies. We should have the exam pattern designed in such a manner to have relevant lab sessions with real life problems (more useful for our future), even with the theories there should be more application based problems than the ones we have encountered so far. Perhaps a 70-30 for labs in near future! </span></div>
