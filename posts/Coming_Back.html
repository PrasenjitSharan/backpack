<div style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">People come back</span>, and there’ve been a bunch of comebacks worth making points, I am making here my comeback on with my laptop and world’s largest selling s/w application called MS word. The difference lies here that mine is not an anticipated one (by many, or at least a few that can be counted using one of my fingers – and that’s me ;-) And you might be wondering reading this what is in it for a comeback here, you don’t even remember when I was around here before. You must have got the impression of the fan following I have, when it comes to writing stuffs and so I’d stop now making this very point of my failure as a talker.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Well</span>, I won’t be kicking me more, and tell you that why you are here reading a new blog with a new bold heading at the top shouting – <span style="font-weight: bold;">‘To My Friends’</span>. You know I got this very idea of writing <span style="font-weight: bold;">to my friends, for my friends</span> (I’ll talk much about them a few <span style="font-weight: bold;">moments</span> – with an undefined definition of <span style="font-weight: bold;">‘moment’</span> – but very soon) at a place / location / room (you can pick your choice) where most of us do most of our thinking / introspection / retrospection etc etc. (Perhaps you’ve guessed it right by now ;-) That apart, no great thing getting fruitful has only one reason behind, mine coming back is not an exception.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Counting</span> a few would not bore you, I guess. Well, one obvious reason is the one that has been the cause of all the great wars (at least in India, in our great history), you guessed it right again, I am sure. And that’s one and first for me also.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The</span> second being our government and policymakers – fighting recession so well – helping markets to come back – forcing companies to re-recruit freshers – and that forcing me to revisit my old, dusty folders housing my resume (nice chain reaction, isn’t it). So for the record my resume said I had blogging as my hobby some 10-12 months ago. And to save the money of reprinting my resume I am gonna go back to my interest. As they say - never put in a lie in your cv because HRs are secret agents who get to know the everything true about you from their spy (who is no one but your roommate ;-)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">And</span> last but not the least I learnt something in my 7th semester. In fact, not during the sems but in the rush hours before the exams. The paper was called Marketing Management and I read there for a countless number of times the term ‘Target Market’. You might not be knowing (now) that I used to call my blog ‘On the write way’ (how I got this title is another story that I’ll tell you in <span style="font-weight: bold;">moments</span>). 'On the write way' had no target market in fact and had posts that were out of my scope to handle – all concerned with some problems – social, national, human (you can scroll down if you are from an NGO or something).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">So</span> ‘To My Friends’ has a target market better call it readers now and that’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">You</span> for a matter of fact. You gonna see your or your roommates’ or your $%^&amp;* rivals’ names and stories more times than a few following these lines.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here</span> goes a look of times to come with the new posts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">I’ll</span> start with none other than my room where we have two gentlemen (none other than Amey and Upen) who are finding new ways to help other guys in the block. The latest and most effective one is to keep the traffic low and sparse at the bathrooms as they are following a path of abstinence (yes only for that as a matter of fact). Hope this results in handing them a few more minutes of studies and this ends after the exams. Well, I am no way behind and getting inspired by their act of spreading brotherly love and chasing hard to beat’em,<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">See</span> you with more in <span style="font-weight: bold;">moments</span>.</div>
