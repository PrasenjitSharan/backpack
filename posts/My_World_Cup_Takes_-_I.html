Title: My World Cup Takes - I

It has become almost routine to wake up in the morning, if 11'o clocks still get counted as mornings ;-) with a cup of tea, wishing to lie in the bed for five more minutes. This (waking up late) is attributed (by my dad) as the result of sub-standard, boring late night world cup matches, that generally end up in a draw or more interestingly in a 1-0 finish.

So, the matches this time around have not been that great. I am not making a judgment out here, football pundits have this view. Well, they are telling that it will become better as the torney progresses.  What I can comment on this year's world cup is only about these little things-
<ol>
	<li><strong>Empty Stands</strong>- It's really shocking to see stands empty, not one or two seats here and there, but long stretches of seats seen waiting for football freaks to take up. FIFA reasons this to corporate reservations that aren't filled up. And another one, people are having transport problems to turn up to the stadiums. Well, nobody will buy these silly reasons, will you?</li>
	<li><strong>The Irritating Buzz</strong>- I still can't figure it out what tradition and culture the people of SA are following with that annoying aaaaaannnnnnn….. sound they spread in and around the stadium. Watching matches on TV is becoming really a challenge to the ear, mind and the neighbors. Somebody stop this please.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li><strong>The Ever-Flying Jabulani</strong>- I don't know why they do it every time (98, 2002 and now 2010). They bring out a ball that doesn’t want to stay on ground and flies like a balloon over the goal posts hitting the TV cameras all the time. Sometimes, it seems that they need to raise the goal post at least 10 ft above the ground to see the shots in the net.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Humiliation (for France)</strong>- Well, last but not the least, les blues sent packing home by an inspired bafana bafana brigade. Being a Thierry Henry and France fan, my world cup seemed to be ended on July the 22nd when a consistent (bad) performance of France prevailed over all the prayers of their fans of seeing them in the knock out stage. They were totally disarrayed. I can't wait to know what waits the team and our very own, beloved Mr Raymond Domenech back home, with some (lady) minister already smashing them (with words ;-)</li>
</ol>

Well, don't get confused, I absolutely hate the man (Raymond do$##%).

Ending on this frustrating note, see you soon :-)
