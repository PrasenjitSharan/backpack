Title: The Journey So Far – I

/*This I had written some 2 months ago, right when I joined Infy, Mysore, so read it keeping that in mind. Things have changed much since, but I don't get chance to update it here due to zillions of reasons :( The commenting style might have given you some clue.*/

Hi, It’s been so long that I could get a chance to open wordpress and post a new entry. It falls in the long list of Infosys security (and what not) policy’s blocked sites and I get a dull page every time I make a (failed) attempt to go to facebook, orkut or even gmail. But, man has always taken over its enemies, even if it’s someone who gives him salary (forget, for the time being, the magnitude of the salary). Ending the speculations, we can access some select proxy websites in order to access the blocked sites and as Amey says Infy has turned poor computer science graduates into real ‘hackers’ J
Well, this is the end of the prologue. I am seeing you guys after so long, so let me tell you how have I been (see the title, if you haven’t yet!). It’s all been fixed and planned (obviously by Infosys) right from the first step that I took in this awesome campus here at Mysore. It really is the same that we used to see on the web, in blogs and flikr. The hostels and facilities are like I’ve never seen before. Hostel rooms and service in particular are (they say) 3 star with LCD Tv, AC, Intercom phone etc etc  and we sometime feel never to leave this place. Well, Mysore DC’s (DC for Development Center)  tagline rightly says as ‘the place to be’. We’ve got Mysore’s only multiplex right in the campus, would you believe it? It screens 2 movies (one Hindi and one English) every weekend. And free tickets are icings on the cake – we get Rs. 150 deducted from our salary every month for everything which comes under the huge umbrella called ‘entertainment’. We’ve got 7 food courts to choose from (more importantly all of them serve north Indian food). Another thing, we don’t have to fix a food court for a month as we used to do in college, where we actually had to pay double – the mess bill as well as to Munna gumti. I don’t know about all, but the food is okay for a person like me and most of you who have survived the great-college-food-court (especially food of Octagon, ewww ;-)
Mornings start (usually) with a rush to class; nothing has changed, isn’t it? We attend the lectures from 9 to 12:30 in the first session, obviously with coffee breaks. This is followed by assignments which generally are no-rocket-science, and we get free by 6 in the evenings. It’s not really true that people used to tell back in the college that you never end up in badminton courts or TT rooms if you are in Infy. In fact, there is a large crowd at these places which range from squash to wall-climbing. Guys from NIST generally are seen in lawn tennis courts (we’ve got 8 of them, the courts, here) or many at swimming pool – they perhaps feel kinda home there! I’ve not changed my liking of Badminton and squeeze out time once in a while for it.
Weather has been on the cooler side here, bringing a change from the hot and humid Berhampur days, though I have to admit that we used to have the best(est) of the evenings back in college, you agree don’t you? Back here, we settle for a new food court and a new item from the (long) menu and at around 8 or 9 in the evening. We head back to hostel (usually) by 11 or 11:30 where rooms wait for us all neat and tidy. The house-keepers clean the rooms while we are in the class. Time to enjoy the sleep which seems really an earned one (I don’t know after how long)!
Hope to see you soon! Bye.
