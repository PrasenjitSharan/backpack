<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">As I sit in front of tv after a not so irksome train journey, with a cup of tea in my hand, I try to scan it quickly so as to stop at one of the umpteen news channels I could find on show (you can find a new one a new day, typically, don’t be amazed if your neighbor finds more). I was a bit out of touch of the things happening around thanks to month long sem end exams.<br /><br />I do have some more liked news channels, but with the exception of those one or two all have become, these days, more of channels for entertainment or say full of masaledar (spiced up) stories, served by presenters seen at different networks on different days. Sometimes my select ones also follow similar trails…thanks to the big market of viewership, the fast race for TRPs. You’ll really get flabbergasted seeing few of them. One channel relayed one day 3-4 doosri duniya ke log (creatures from space) peeking one window - they said that window could be yours any day and they (the aliens) were looking for your kids (perhaps for some research up there!). Once our most venerable Sai Baba spoke on tv - latter it was disproved by some other network as jaadu (wonder) of animation. It really hurts you when you see such stories on news channels in a country where people deserve so much in the race to move forward.<br /><br />Looking at the brighter side, these channels with such reports and stories really provide some serious comedy stuff to viewers like us who are having quite a good number of options to choose from tv shows featuring stand-up comedians (and of course the presenters ). Apart from the return of money-making shows, every single channel has its own stand-up comedy show - again with the exception of a few, most of them serve same cheap, substandard junk with same brazenness over and over again. And the suro ka sangram (the vocal battle) can't get out of sight in your brief spell in front of the small screen. Well, let’s give some respite to the entertaining networks as they show up what they are supposed to.<br /><br />But what upsets me most is the trend of informative networks - basically the news channels or the media, their inclination towards hot, curried news even if it comes at the expense of some very much looked-for facts. The questions are being raised regarding the role of media in various sensitive issues (and very rightly so as in case of the murder of a 14 years old recently). The media, sometimes, seems to be drawing conclusions only on the basis of some very raw facts, and making someone, in a moment, a villain for humanity or a hero of the society. All these are being done only to bring out some sensational story for the mass containing high melodrama.<br /><br />The way that media have been helping the society a great deal towards its empowerment, though they should feel more responsibility for the message that unfolds due to some silly, immature journalism from their part.</span>
