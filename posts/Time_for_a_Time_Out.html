<div align="left"><br /><br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Morning had more tranquility that day, as had my mind, for, I woke up not having in my mind an idealistic portion of syllabus to cover for the exams. The month long goings on to steer clear an unwelcome letter opposite a paper in the grade sheet had come to a much wanted windup. I had to get done with my baggage for the journey to home as it was the onset of the summer break -- These vacations are no longer like the earlier ones of school days meant for full blown fun, but have become periods to get into extra courses and trainings -- the man today feels himself so insecure that even the time meant for recreation and repose are spent preparing to battle out next challenges better than the others. Well, that’s the way it is, you can't complain being competitive and advanced.<br /><br />It was a journey without much fuss and fun, things were right at there places- my train was only 35 minutes late, right after midnight (so I calculated quite correctly that it'd reach at least 1hr 35min late at my last stop and so I'd not have to wake up early next morning), I found my fellow passengers almost tolerable, to me of course, ( I've not been fortunate most of the times!) and my mobile phone was still on at morning (my poor phone's backup is not the best in business mostly). I came out of station taking the shortcut and found as usual, copious auto wallahs asking for the destinations they were looking for (one thing for sure, whenever you feel that nobody cares for you and you are of no worth in this world, go by my advice, take a small sack on your shoulder and have a walk at the railway or bus station, these are the places to feel it). Not a single left me unseen, I tried to ignore most of them and stopped at one which looked most indigent of all. In the way, I tried to talk to him, but he responded to my humdrum queries only in yes and no (he lacked the confidence which a person with big bucks in his wallet has, I wondered why is that the determining factor of one's sureness most of the times).<br /><br /><br />And as I am reading 'The Inheritance of Loss' by Kiran Desai which tells story , with other things, of the separatist movement of Indian-Nepali insurgents in the mountains, I see stories on 24 hour news channels of the group of community in Rajasthan demanding themselves to be declared as the class which enjoys a greater share in the great Indian dissemination of quotas and reservations. All result of pre election promises made by our beloved statesmen - promises which only to be written in manifestoes and talked about before election. They make their words extremely viable no matter how unworkable those might be (same case here). Poor politicians don’t have a way out till now as the next elections are at the doorsteps and not a single person can be left complaining in these slog overs.<br /><br />Gearing up for similar mind-boggling stories the whole month of my divine summer vacation and for the long classes which will add up a new, perhaps attractive column in my resume the next year when I take on the challenge with many thousands for a few hundred spots to make the mind feel secure, at least for a few days.<br /></span></div>
