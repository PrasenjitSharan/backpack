Title: Busy (For a Change)

Hi Folks!

These have been 2 days that really counted during the stay at home this time around, tiresome and busy for a change. I will try to recount the hours. I could not manage to better my timings of getting off the bed. And as soon as I did that I got all the reminders for the day and I was off outside in half an hour. I ordered for my new specs. Well, nothing new by looks of the frame, it'll be new just by feel and moreover shall be felt by not many but only me (obviously). Thanks to the great numbers that I have for a (close to) right eyesight, they donâ€™t suggest any other but the simplest of the designs for my frame. Nothing of your interest, this specs issue of mine for you, right? But after all, I own this blog; I should get at least this many lines dedicated to me.

Moving on, I had to have some photographs done. Some passport and stamp sized ones for joining formalities at Infosys. Then, I had to move to railway station to see Upen off to Kerala. For people who don't know this guy, here is a quick take on him.

Upen had been my room-mate for the 4 years at my college. One of his kind, mind-my-own-business kind of person, very talented in the fields of gaming, eating (especially when the food come for free ;-), drinking and cheating in exams. And awful when it comes to outdoor sports and social service. And yes, the most important thing about this man- he is the only one from the college to get through Indian Navy selected as a Sub-Lieutenant in command. Really a gem :-)

So, my previous room-mate is off to Kerala for 6 month long (dreadful) training there. I am sure he will survive and will do well.

I went to a small hospital then to know about the medical tests to be done as a (one more) pre-joining formality for Infy. Went to meet Swati at her sister's. And for people who don't know her I will enlighten you guys sometime later. Then there was again all the sporting actions that I couldn't afford to miss. Rafael Nadal winning his 3rd round match in 5 sets. He defeated some unpronounceable named German who fought well. He really had a terrible name, just one vowel in his 20 odd letters long name.

Came today, and I had to struggle with the calendar to manage my next few days here. I have to go to my (elder) brother's place in one or two days to spend some time out there. Then I have to leave for Gurgoan to my sister. This makes up to the 6th of next month and then I am off to Mysore on 9th. In between I have to manage all the things related to my joining- Passport, PAN card, medical tests, shopping and what not. Really going to have my running shoes on for the next few days.

Thanks for the patience for this really long post! See you soon.

PS: Dheeraj (tell you later about him) is finally going to his hometown Ranchi after enjoying Vizag, Puri and of course Berhampur. Amey(my other room-mate- for those who don't know this guy well) called today. He is waiting for his interview results which due tomorrow i.e. 28th that was for his M.Tech at ISI, Kolkata. If you have read this far, you must then wish him all the very best. I surely did :-)
