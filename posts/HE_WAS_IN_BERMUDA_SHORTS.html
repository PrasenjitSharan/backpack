<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">It was a cool evening when I with two of my friends went to have some snack out in the small fast food shop at the college gate. After finishing my grub I started chatting with them, when a very small tot appeared and carried our plates from the stool in front of us. My witty friend pranked on that and we started laughing as we usually do. Actually he had said about the child who was working in that shop and had commented on the government and the child labor in India. We returned hostel and forgot the incident as expected, perhaps it was a no incident for us, if I be honest.<br /><br />But now I remember the kid who was slogging in that breezy evening in his Bermuda shorts and a half shirt, serving and removing plates and washing those using icy water of the tub. He should have been in his home, sitting beside fire and enjoying hot sips of tea made by his mother. This is the story of every nook of the market, in most of the shops, in houses, schools, offices everywhere.<br /><br />Child labor is an issue that we have been listening and reading since our childhood and is the most disturbing matter to me. Childhood is the workshop for the making of a man who would shape the country in future. This is the period in life to play and enjoy, to forget all the worries of life and to be ready for building the tomorrow better. This making is both physically and mentally. Children involved in various jobs suffer not only from the fact that they remain uneducated but also their bodily development is hindered.<br /><br />The country might be galloping at a growth rate of over 10%, Sensex smashing all the records and the nation gaining strategic wins at international conferences, but to me these are all things to write in news papers and televising the breaking news on TV channels. On the ground I don’t see any difference, the situation has been the same for the last 10-12 years which I remember, I may sound cynic, but these stats have been of no use for those children working on streets. Government has got many bright plans on but all on papers, only to answer in the parliament and to the journalists. The main reason behind the sluggish growth in this very field has been the failure of the system to provide the primary education right from the independence. This might be due to a faulty structure of things, all the way from poor income of citizen to their illiteracy. How can a man struggling for his two ends meal send his son or daughter to a school to have learning? Here I want exclude, from the list of schools, most of those government schools which don’t have benches for students to sit and are more used for our fabulous(and lengthy) electoral process and polio drop camps (I don’t want to stress more on the unlearning environment there). Helpless, he is forced to send his child to the corner's store for 300-400 rupees a month and thus a beautiful childhood is spent toiling, doing loads of works with delicate and tender hands, the hands which should have a pencil and a ball.<br /><br />I am no expert and have not a single master plan and idea to eradicate this unfortunate shame from the society, neither I have a genie who can fix things up( perhaps a strict and practical law will help). But I, rather we, can do our bit to help those unlucky fellows. Whatever be our way of effort towards that, we must join hands and add yet another victory over yet another stigma on our society.<br /></span>
