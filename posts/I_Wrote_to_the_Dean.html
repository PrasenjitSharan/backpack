<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;"><em>(I always feel it painful to see little kids working in shops, hotels, places, and in the market , but I can't help it but have got only a few cantankerous remarks to make when I am among friends(I don’t know how much they appreciate it, if they do at all). Well, you'd say why not get help of some NGO or teach people the laws, but you also know the problems. But, this time it is my college and my hostel, children work in the canteen day and night. Here is the letter I passed to the director and the dean of the college (I didn't find it the greatest of the ideas to go to the police or the press against my own college). Take this post of mine as the invitation to come to my college with the police and media, of course if you are not a student of it as am I. So, it goes like this…)<br /></em> <br /><br />Dear Sir,<br /><br />A wholehearted hello to you as we enter to the all important year of our life - the year we move into the 3rd year of our B tech study. A letter now (I am writing for the first time to drop it into the suggestion/complaint box kept outside your cabin) as I have got to know from my friends, seniors, and of course from you that you ponder over the notes yourself.<br /><br />The objective of the letter zeros in (again) to our campus hostel. No sir, its not again the quality of food or the internet connection but something different. Not taking much of your time, I want to bring a very serious issue up, even though it is not felt by most of us most of the times. I'd like you to reflect upon the kids toiling out here in the food court and the kitchen of the canteen.<br /><br />Sir, they belong to the tender age group of 8 - 16, the time which is for them to go to schools and have funfairs in playgrounds. Unfortunately they are here, steering trolleys filled with the plates used by others. They've got an inhuman shift of work that starts at as early as 5 in the morning (when you and I stay in warmth of our beds- not sure about you sir, but I am for sure in my snooze till at least 6.30) and which ends I don’t know when because even at 11 at night they can be seen in the food court cleaning the tables and chairs. This is really terrible sir, be it any place of the world, making children work and that at a place which is going to give out the next bunch of intellects to the society can't be criticized in a letter of 200 words. You are the head of the institution sir and I think you should take the moral responsibility for this act of denunciation. And this time sir, any line of reasoning from your side is absolutely unthinkable. At this place you are supposed to be heading a charity sir, providing these children (at least these out here!) the class rooms of schools instead of a mess to work in 24*7.<br /><br />I don’t know how you are taking this letter, sir. You are smirking at me on my act of foolishness who is trying to teach ethics to a person who his by far and far superior to him at every aspect possible or you are thinking over it seriously, I don’t know sir. Now it’s up to you sir to make or break. When I will look back at my college days after four years, your act of now will decide, whether I'll be a proud man who could do his bit for the society or the most ashamed man who couldn’t do any further than writing a small letter to his dean.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <em>PS: I will post after a few days what they did about it, if they make this fine, please don't make you too bothered to visit us. And if you are too desperate to act on, please mail me, I’ve got many more stories (of course true ones) for you.</em></span>
