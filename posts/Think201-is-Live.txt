Hello there!! Hope you are fine.

Think201.com is live now. Details I wont give you here as I want some hits on the site. What I can tell you is, if you are a potential client, go to the last page of the site there, fill up the small form and click on send. We shall get back to you at the earliest 

On a serious note, this is the website of the Graphics Design Studio, I have been part of (officially and unofficially) for quite sometime now. Name is new though, we had started it up with a different name, but you never know where (and when) you end up ultimately.

And since you have taken the pain reading through these lines, it wont harm you clicking another link.  Cheers!!

Bye for now.

PS: Here is the link again- think201 official.
