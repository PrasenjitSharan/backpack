<div align="justify"><br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">It was the anniversary celebration of my college magazine. I and 3-4 of my friends were also there to attend that (there were many other reasons that we showed ourselves up there; well I won't go in there today). It was a very usual kind of episode, team president anchoring the show, the director delivering an overzealous, fanatical speech (as always) and two of the editors using such kind complicated and impenetrable lingo (again a usual show) that we eased ourselves by 10-15 minute snooze.<br /><br />Well, I may seem too grouchy but this was what happened. But one more thing was on the card, it was a presentation by the chief guest (he was some very well known media personality whom I didn’t know, in fact). He started off with the words 'The Future is Bright' and 'India Shining' and all that. We thought it was just another talk with a long list of stats showing the 'emergent' India, but it was gem of a presentation, a marvelous observation and thinking. The central idea revolved around the fact of the development deficit in the country. Once he showed the picture of world class office of 'Reliance' with world's 2nd largest screen for display (it was recently in magazines) and on the next, people on streets, hungry and wretched, begging and desolate. In one he showed pools of water, people enjoying and in the other an endless queue of women lining up for water to drink. He showed the difference between the crust and the ground, the rich and the poor and the privileged and the deprived. I'd like to share his effort a bit more (of course, if he doesn’t take it the other way).<br />The terms used were 'India' and 'Bharat' (I saw these in the next day's editorial of a national daily also). In the concept, there is a difference between the names. The difference eventually is the reason behind difference between the rich and the poor in the country. One may have an endless list of achievements, records and stats to prove the pace of an insurgent and 'shining' India but on the other hand we also are extremely behind in many areas right from illiteracy to unemployment and from…leave it here( I don’t know when would I end up…I consider this to be implied). In 'India' there lives an Indian rejoicing the bull market (going up and up and up), partying in 5 star hotels and clubs and sending his son to Harvard and in 'Bharat' there lives a farmer having left with no option but to stop his children's studies, to sell out his left over land and fields and keep fighting with his misfortune. Truly, we are here, in the country full of contradictions and absurdities, we have one of the world's richest and fastest economies simultaneously one of the largest population under poverty line, the most diverse society on the globe.<br /><br />Truly (with all the sincerity, at least from my side), it’s the time for introspection and to trim the gap down between the privileged and the deprived. Obviously plans have been being chalked out, money has been being spent but the needed results are out of sight. Unfortunately these (the money and the plans) have to travel a long path full of selfish, corrupt and irresponsible people (start counting…officials, politicians, policemen, lawyers, ministers, clerks, you and I ) from the files of bills and schemes to the bare hands of the needy. The reason of our misfortune is that we have left our values far behind our own interests. We won't get a way out of it until we, people reclaim our ethics and morals back, trace the path what great men have shown, think above the self and be advanced with integrity. Soon 'Bharat' will feel like ‘India’.<br /></span></div>
