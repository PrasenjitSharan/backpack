Title: Howdy

Hi there! My new(er) blog!

Been always cursing myself for not updating my log over here (i m sure most of you also do that, that gives me some reasons not to jump off a cliff to punish me, jokin;-)

So, i have not waited for my internet connection to get fixed this time round and right now sitting in a cafe and updating my little new blog. this seems to be pretty better than sitting at home and doing stuff on the laptop!

These days gearing myself up for joining infosys, mysore. the pre joining formalities and all.

see you guys soon!
