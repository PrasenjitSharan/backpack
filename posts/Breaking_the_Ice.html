Title: Breaking the Ice

Hi, hope you are doing great.

Not many times I get a chance to spend time with my laptop on weekdays. I wont explain much and tell you again that I’ve been busy these months. I’ve been telling this to everyone I get a chance to say even a hello. Perhaps, you have also just come out of or going through the transition from college to a cubicle.

Okay, so a quick round of recap from my side. And that is because, as always, I am having a dire determination of seeing you again here. So just to break the ice, lets talk about…umm..Football? No, not many would be interested…politics? Nopes..its all the same, nothing much to talk, certain Anna Hajare gave many of us a new topic to post on Facebook (don’t raise your brow, if you are a <em>pro-anti-corruption</em>-<em>rebel</em>), besides giving us a chance to speak up against corruption, laws, bills and what not…

Weather? Yes!!

<a href="http://prasenjitsharan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/rain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-70" title="200236712-001" src="http://prasenjitsharan.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/rain.jpg?w=300" alt="Its been raing in Bangalore" width="300" height="200" /></a>

It rained in Bangalore today. It was the second rain in four days time. But I couldn’t enjoy it, as I was in my cubicle, no bad; I could enjoy the wet roads, soaked cycle seats (for those who don’t know, we have cycles in the campus to commute, I generally take them to go from my office building to the nearest food court), and the dripping trees. Man, I just discovered the poet within me J

Now, some local and not so local news. I’ll try to put as many as I can; only relevant ones though.

Anshu, Ruchi, Jaggy, Fakhru and PDG came on WC final day weekend here. We had <em>fun</em>. I’ll explain the funny and not so funny experience later.  Dheeraj couldn’t make it, reason unknown to me, but we missed him a lot. And yes, we had Amit Ranjan with us all the way. He is also Bangalored and so is Saurabh, for his summer internship, as far as I know. We met Suranjita, the same weekend and two other girls from college (those two girls- hope you aren’t reading this K

Pradeep has been posting awesome photographs on Facebook (go and check <a title="Praddy's photo blog" href="http://www.facebook.com/worldpixelated" target="_blank">World Pixelated</a> there if you haven’t done already) and Vipin also has been showing his hands on with his <em>Nikkon-an alphabet followed by some digits</em>- that’s for model number.

Pratichi, comes to Bangalore, more often than not and she’s got her posting here, from May 19<sup>th</sup>. that’s good J

Swati, is all the same, she has joined a Dance class and that (dancing) is her new passion, well, these days ;) She stays with most of the girls from the gang back from college. I wonder they would stay together right till 2012, when the world ends. Yes, I believe in Mayans more than most of the people around.

Jayendra got into Mahindra Satyam; I see one more cubicle-gladiator in the making.

Upen calls now and then, if you are him reading this, thanks a lot for updating whatever is going on there. Divya, used to call but now he has lost all hopes of getting a call or text back from me so he hasn’t called for quite sometime. I guess that is the only reason J Anyways, if you also haven’t heard form him, he is doing great in college, his M.Tech. Siddharth, he is also in Bangalore, but you must be knowing much about him, thanks to Twitter and Facebook.

Me, I am staying in a flat that is on the 18<sup>th</sup> floor, that is worth telling so couldn’t stop. I stay with 3 other room-mates, Chetan, Gaurav and Piyush, will get you introduced sometime, if you can’t make a picture of them in your mind. I’ll post snaps or something J

It’s been really frustrating time <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2638/english-angle/2011/04/29/2463531/its-not-all-bad-10-reasons-for-arsenal-fans-to-cheer-up" target="_blank">being an Arsenal fan</a>, perhaps that stadium is cursed or the club is concentrating more on charity works than training sessions. But Gunners for life, till death makes us apart J Hoping the season to get over soon and start everything again.

Well, even if these are the days of <em>Cloud, </em>space matters and this news thing has spanned more than you expected. And its getting  a little boring now, so will give you updates later sometime; of people I have missed, there are so many really. And its 12 in my watch, so stopping now, my cubicle would be waiting for me tomorrow.

Hope to see you soon.
