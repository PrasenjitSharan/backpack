Title: Howdy!

Hi you,

So the long(est)-lasting Isner-Mahut match has finally ended, I came to know. For those who didn’t get a clue about these two guys (now you know that these two are actually human beings ;-), they just concluded the longest ever match that the Tennis history has ever witnessed. Can you believe this- the final set went to a score of 70-68. Hats off to the two players, Mahut prevailed ultimately though. I strongly recommend to google this match to see the jaw-dropping records set in the match. I surely did :-)

Everything around you is sports these days with all the football, tennis and cricket all over the place. India winning the Asia cup, finally. And yes, another Blue team bowed out of the world cup, surprisingly. The Azzurri followed the path of Les Bleus to get knocked out after finishing the group at the bottom below the New Zealand. I wonder if there is something wrong with the color blue this world cup. Talking about the French, I came to see the replay of the match yesterday. It was really a disgrace from Raymond Domenech's part (I don't  really know the spelling of his last name neither do I care to know) not to shake hands with South African coach after the match. Well, Lippi did well, he moved to the dressing room straight away.

Moving away from sports for the time being, everything else seems so routinely these days. Wake up at 11, tea, breakfast, TV, football, phone calls and Internet, again football and then the boring sleep. I can’t believe myself but I really am missing the good old college days, the hostel, room-mates, friends, chit-chats, fights, gumti, lawn, dumb charades, again gumti, late-night stays in others' rooms, movies, town, college bus and what not. I can go on and on and on. I guess others also must be feeling this. Good for the guys who have moved so early to their places be it their MBAs, M Techs and some even have joined the companies ;-)

Talking of the routine stuff, I got to do something new today, have the appointment with my eye specialist doctor. Hope not to have got my numbers, cylinders, axes blah blah increased more. And yes, they (people at my home) are not in favor of me having contact lens (again). Their arguments are never ending and I can't defend more.

See you soon, Bye :-)
