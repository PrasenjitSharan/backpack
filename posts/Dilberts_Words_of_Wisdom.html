Title: Dilbert’s Words of Wisdom

Howdy dears!

There has been a file in my laptop that I look into every now and then, which has some 30-odd one-liners from the famed Scott Adams creation Dilbert. It would be unfair from my part if I don’t share some of them out here. So, these are a few from them which I am sure will prove to be exceedingly valuable to you at the place. So if you already have a salary account and are soon to have one, go through these following lines and use them in future. They will guide you to victory. Remember these are always true and/or would prove to be.
<ul>
	<li>Eat one live toad first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day.</li>
	<li>Accept that some days you are the pigeon and some days the statue.</li>
	<li>Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level and beat you with their experience.</li>
	<li>A pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the ass.</li>
	<li>* Don't be irreplaceable - if you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.</li>
	<li>After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the month than you did before.</li>
	<li>When bosses talk about improving productivity, they are never talking about themselves.</li>
	<li>If at first you don't succeed, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it.</li>
	<li>* Everything can be filed under 'miscellaneous'.</li>
	<li>Never delay the ending of a meeting or the beginning of a cocktail hour.</li>
	<li>Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he/she is supposed to be doing.</li>
	<li>* Important letters that contain no errors will develop errors in the mail.</li>
	<li>If you are good, you will be assigned all the work. If you are really good, you will get out of it.</li>
	<li>* You are always doing something marginal when the boss drops by your desk.</li>
	<li>People who go to conferences are the ones who shouldn't.</li>
	<li>* If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done.</li>
	<li>At work, the authority of a person is inversely proportional to the number of pens that person is carrying.</li>
	<li>Following the rules will not get the job done. Getting the job done is no excuse for not following the rules.</li>
	<li>* When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried.</li>
</ul>
Good for you, you went through these. Thank me ;-)
