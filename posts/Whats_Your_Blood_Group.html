Title: What’s Your Blood Group?

Howdy folks!

Here is a nice little advice for you, if you are not already married. This comes from the doctor I went for medical tests. Here it goes-

So, I am sitting beside my doctor who is looking at the medical reports of mine and is ready to measure my blood pressure. He asks me seeing my blood group- has your blood group always been B negative? I mean right from childhood? I think - awesome, great question to start with. I say ya, I guess it's been the same. He then asks about the blood groups of my family members. And there comes his advice. Well, according to him, a girl with a negative and a guy with a positive blood group aren't ideal for marrying, and of course not just marrying ;-) It is related something about the child that is born. Don’t want to go in to detail of that. But he says this.

So, "Provided the girl's blood group is negative the blood groups shouldn’t ideally be of different signs." Seems like a theorem isn't is ;-)

According to this theorem, I am free to marry any girl, positive or negative, because my blood group is negative. Hence, in case girl's blood group is negative, it isn't of opposite sign of mine. And if it is positive, well positive blood group is the desired one for girls, of course according to this doc.

Even if it seemed bullshit to you, you can't help because you have already read this. Can't go back now :-) and in case you want this doc's number, contact me.

Be careful!
