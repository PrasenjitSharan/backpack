Title: Leaving Port

Hi,

I couldn't manage 15 minutes with my laptop that's why you can see no posts for the last few days. Last few days have been full of travel, shopping and preparations. I've got to tell so much right now, but don't have time again :(

Enough of complains, things that you should know for now are like this-

* I am leaving tomorrow for Mysore and with me in the same train would be Chandrashekhar Jha and Co. and Richa as far my connections are concerned. Anshu, Sadique and a few more people (I hope) would be joining later next week.

* Amey has got 80% chance now to join TCS. Well Dheeraj has got 100.

* Pratichi and Aarti are performing excellently at their place, standing first (both of them... strange;-) in the assessment, I heard from her.

* Swati is enjoying at her home now (finally) her cousin's marriage, that's tomorrow. No further comments, though i am dying to do so :(

* They have increased the salary during training at Infy. Nice news, isn't it?

* And last but not the least, Prashant is always online, so you can chat with him, if you have time to spare ;-)

See you soon, perhaps from Infosys, Mysore.

Take care.

PS: I've become all brand new, with all the shopping. You name a thing and I have a new version of that. Specs, Tie, Cell phone, obviously formals, shoes and even slippers :-) Perhaps, its not that bad to join a new company and that too soon.
