Title: Back Home

Howdy!

Long time, no see- you would say. Yeah, I know. But you know the thing is, the network I mostly work on these days doesn’t block Wordpress (and other blogging sites as a matter of fact). This I could discover only yesterday. And I said Whoa! They don’t block my blog here. Pinged everyone with a smiley. Pinging and smilies- so much part of life now. Oops, going in wrong direction, will talk about the cubicle and managers sometime later ;)

So I am back to my online home again and will be updating regularly this place like never before. After all, I don’t have to buy space here, all I need to do is to squeeze out a few minutes from the (ultra)busy schedule I’ve been having for some 3-4 months now. I hope that gives an excuse why I have been invisible for all these months. Talking of schedule, I gotta go back to work and break head with my requirement that is already past deadline. Well almost :)

See you soon, Bye.
