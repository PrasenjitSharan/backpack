Title - The Week That Was

Hey, how u doin?

Reminds me of Joey!! Dheeraj, this was for you ;-)

Happy Mother's Day! No, this post aint about Moms. I wont be able to fit in all here that I’d like to say!

Sunday evening, and again a long week looms in front that I want to see get passed <em>zip-zap-zoom</em> and so do you, I am sure.

I saw the office exit gate at or before 8 in the evenings, this was some change. Hope to experience my evenings like this the whole year. Amen!

Osama Bin Laden is dead. No conspiracy theory from me. I will go with the powerful in this case. Man Utd just beat Chelsea 2-1. Season is there’s now I guess. Heard Sehwag was unstoppable that day, could witness Gayle’s towering sixes though.

As far as people I know are concerned everyone’s doing fine, nothing much to tell. Upen, Sub Lt Upendra, rather, had called today, he is in Vizag for a trip of 2 weeks and will be back to Academy after that. Most importantly, he has his Passing-Out-Parade on June 4<sup>th</sup>. Proud moment, for all of us!! Amey is off to Bombay for his interview, so best wishes for him.

Dheeraj has been busy attending (1 or 2 of 50000) marriages and is anticipating his turn. And Anshu, I don’t know his caller tune for Mother’s day, I am sure he has something new in store. Swati is on her way back from Mysore, again, after attending someone’s (from her office) marriage.

Pratichi is enjoying Chennai, yes, you read it right, she is enjoying the place, people I know are finding hard to survive. My friends from Madras, please excuse, I know that’s the best place on Earth for you.

Saurabh is slowly but surely replacing Siddharth as the most-active when we talk about getting social. C’mon Siddharth, heat up the race. There’s still no news from Divya. Another great news, Prashant is going Onsite, if a few things go right. He is almost there though. Congratulations. I don’t know if he has told this to people, or if he wants this to be told now at all, but this is too good, so I couldn’t help but tell you this.

For me, I worked on my website. I had hoped to have this very post on that but couldn’t complete it on time. Hopefully the next one will be there J And btw, think201 is online now, saying again. And I updated my profile at Naukri dot com ;)

I am afraid my news edition ends here, be thankful to Facebook, you know everything about people you care about. By everything, I mean what they want you to know!

One more thing, thanks for liking the last post. I got +1s from so many of you, which included Shruthi. For people who don’t know her, she is an outstanding writer and was part of Gurukul in Mysore and now is in YOU here at Bangalore.

Rest all is fine. See you again. Peace till then.

PS: For Geeks, i didn’t know about CSS3 could do this much!!
